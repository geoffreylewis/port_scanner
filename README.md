## Built With

## Version History 

**Version 0.1**

* This script is functional already, but I don't want to call it done yet.
* I would like to make further tweaks to it before listing it as Version 1.0.

I've begun the "Practical Ethical Hacking" course by TCM Security Academy (taught by Heath Adams).  Shout out to them for getting me started with a basic port scanner.
